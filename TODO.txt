TODO prio list:
	0. Remove old and unnecessary functions.
		-> Add a "ReceiveData()" and "SendData()" function for both server and client. move all relevant data to those, and call both those functions in order inside Update.

	1. Make server pingback all text you write to it.
		-> Server has the receive stuff from clients phase.
		-> Server parses data. Adds it to a "sendback" buffer, if necessary.
		-> Server then has a sendback phase, where it will send all data back to clients.

		-> All clients have a "Receive stuff from server" phase as first thing in their update.
			-> When server sends text back, maybe it also sends text colour and username
		-> Then all clients have a normal send stuff phase.

	2. Fix SSAO. Possibly change the way normals are stored and add a new RT for 2 materials + lerp value between them


Features:
* Make different sorts of packets for things. NameChange, ColourChange. Etc. PlayerData struct? Server map is <uint, PlayerData>. Socket will be contained in PlayerData.
	-> http://content.gpwiki.org/Binary_Packet_Code
	-> http://www.gamedev.net/index.php?app=forums&module=forums&section=rules&f=15 Q15

* Split GameConsoleWindow up into two types. Have one ... ChatRoom? That inherits from ConsoleWindow. 
	-> ConsoleWindow will only have the text parsing/printing stuff. ChatRoom will have all the namechanging and colourchanging and shit as well.
	-> Meaning that you can have a console window that only renders text that you send to it, without any of the naming/colouring stuff.

									//R and G can each hold 1024 distinct values. The B channel can hold potential lerp value between these two.
* ... Use one more RT for materials. DXGI_FORMAT_R10G10B10A2_UNORM?

* In the future, it would probably be relevant to try and implement texture ID per vertex. One uint, two IDs bitshifted into each 16 bits. To blend between them you'd use some form of noise map.
	if(id >= 16 bits of value)
	{
		//Means that the second part of the uint contains something, so we blend
		get id2 by bitshifting

		blend between two ids by using some form of seamless noise map
	}

* TODO: Instead of a map... Maybe use four 2D vectors. One for -1-1, one for -1 1, one for 1 -1 and one for 1 1 ... should work fine

* Depth only OBJ shader for shadow stage

* Non-simplex/perlin smooth noise
	-> Using this function, stuff like waves, marble etc will be possible

* Simple rain or snow screen shader 

* Spotlight shader

* RTW shadowmapping < Cuz it's fuckin' awesome.

* Make geometry shader grass more fancy.
	-Should pretty much be finished now, just need to do the lookup-based-on-height thing.

* Particles
	-> Finally look into compute shader..?

* Water normal texture sliding thing that they do in arma2

########## Idea regarding vegetation lookup table ##################

First you have a lookup texture, a 1DTextureArray that has the same amount of textures as you have height in the world. You index into this texture array with the grassquad's worldPos.Y
Each texture has the first pixel allocated to the amount of textures ID there are for this height. So you read the first pixel value to know how many textures there are in this texture.
Then, when you know how many textures there are, you randomly select which texture you want to use. And then Load(1+(RandomVal*AmountOfTextures)). 
1+ because you don't want to use the first pixel in the texture.

Then you use the loaded texture ID to sample from your texture2DArray

if dot(cameraDirection, lightDirection) == -1 then they're both facing opposite ways I think
